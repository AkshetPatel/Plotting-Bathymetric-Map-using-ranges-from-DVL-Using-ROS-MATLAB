### Aims and Objectives
#### The aim and objectives for the project titled “Software development of Bathymetric Map generation using ranges from Doppler Velocity Log for C-Bot” are:
1. To plot the bathymetric map of the seabed using the data captured by the Doppler Velocity Log (DVL)
2. To Develop an algorithm for the correction of roll, pitch, and yaw motion of the beams of the DVL
3. To simulate the algorithm and code on ‘uuvsimulator’ (A Gazebo-based package for underwater intervention and multi-robot simulation)
4. To validate the results using Rviz (A 3D visualization tool for ROS applications)
5. To create a ROS package using Python Programming Language. <br>
